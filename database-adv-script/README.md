# 🔗 SQL JOIN Queries – Airbnb Clone Project

## 📂 Overview
This directory contains SQL queries that demonstrate the use of different types of JOINs in a relational database. These are essential for combining data from multiple related tables. In this project, we use three main types of JOINs:

- INNER JOIN
- LEFT JOIN
- FULL OUTER JOIN

Each query is written based on the Airbnb Clone schema to retrieve relevant data in a realistic business context.

---

## 1️⃣ INNER JOIN – Bookings with User Information
### 🔍 Purpose:
Retrieve a list of all bookings **along with the users who made them**.

---

## 2️⃣ LEFT JOIN – All Properties and Their Reviews
### 🔍 Purpose:

Retrieve all properties and any associated reviews, including properties that have no reviews.

---

## 3️⃣ FULL OUTER JOIN – All Users and Bookings
### 🔍 Purpose:
Retrieve all users and all bookings, even if there’s no match between them.

# 🧠 Subqueries in SQL – Airbnb Clone

## 📂 Overview
This directory showcases two types of SQL subqueries:
1. **Non-Correlated Subquery** – Runs independently of the outer query.
2. **Correlated Subquery** – References a column from the outer query row-by-row.

These examples are applied in realistic scenarios based on the Airbnb Clone project’s database schema.

---

## 1️⃣ Non-Correlated Subquery – Properties With High Ratings
### 🎯 Goal:
Find all properties that have an **average review rating greater than 4.0**.

---

## 2️⃣ Correlated Subquery – Active Users by Booking Count
### 🎯 Goal:
Retrieve users who have made more than 3 bookings.
