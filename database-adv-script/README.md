# 🔗 SQL JOIN Queries – Airbnb Clone Project

## 📂 Overview
This directory contains SQL queries that demonstrate the use of different types of JOINs in a relational database. These are essential for combining data from multiple related tables. In this project, we use three main types of JOINs:

- INNER JOIN
- LEFT JOIN
- FULL OUTER JOIN

Each query is written based on the Airbnb Clone schema to retrieve relevant data in a realistic business context.
